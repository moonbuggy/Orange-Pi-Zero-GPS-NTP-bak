# Orange Pi Zero GPS NTP Server - old
I screwed up a bit with Git Large File Storage. Annoyingly, the only way
to remove large files from GitHub is to delete the repo.

So I've renamed this here and recreated the repo at the
[original URL](https://github.com/moonbuggy/Orange-Pi-Zero-GPS-NTP).
I'll delete this repo in a few days.
